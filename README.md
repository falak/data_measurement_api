### RVM and Ruby

It is typically recommended to install Ruby with RVM. With RVM, you can specify the version of Ruby you want
installed, plus a whole lot more (e.g. gemsets). Full installation instructions for RVM are [available online](http://rvm.io/rvm/install/).

This app is developed using Ruby 2.6.3 and we recommend using version 2.6.3 or higher. To install TeSS' current version of ruby and set ruby version 2.6.3 as default, you
can do something like the following:

    $ rvm install `cat .ruby-version`

    $ rvm use --default `cat .ruby-version`

* Configuration
